# ExercisesAndAlgorithms
A repository to store and study: 
* Algorithms
* Computer Science Terms / Glossary
* Coding exercises
* StackOverflow excercises/answers
* Interview tips/hints

At this time, only Java 8 will be used. In the future, I may add other languages. Feel free to submit a pull
request if you want to translate some of the exercises into another language.
