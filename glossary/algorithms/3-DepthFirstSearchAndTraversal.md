# Depth-First Search (DFS) and Depth-First Traversal

Depth-first search (DFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS, you go as deep as possible down one path 
before backing up and trying a different one.

Depth-first search is like walking through a corn maze. You explore one path, hit a dead end, and go 
back and try a different one.

Here's a how a DFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root:
1. We'd go down the first path we find until we hit a dead end.
2. Then we'd do the same thing againâ€”go down a path until we hit a dead end.
3. And again, until we've visited every node in the tree.

Depth-first search is often compared with breadth-first search.

Advantages:
* Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
* Depth-first search can be easily implemented with recursion.

Disadvantages:
* A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
