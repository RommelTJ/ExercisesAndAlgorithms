# Data Structures Overview

To really understand how data structures work, we're going to derive each of them from scratch. 
Starting with bits.

Don't worry — we'll skip the convoluted academic jargon and proofs.

We'll cover:
* Random Access Memory
* Binary Numbers
* Fixed-Width Integers
* Arrays
* Strings
* Pointers
* Dynamic Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Hash Tables
