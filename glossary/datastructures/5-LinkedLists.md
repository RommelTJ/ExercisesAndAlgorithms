# Linked Lists

## Quick reference

|         | Worst Case |
| ------- | ---------- |
| space   | O(n)       |
| prepend | O(1)       |
| append  | O(1)       |
| lookup  | O(n)       |
| insert  | O(n)       |
| delete  | O(n)       |

A linked list organizes items sequentially, with each item storing a pointer to the next one.

Picture a linked list like a chain of paperclips linked together. It's quick to add another 
paperclip to the top or bottom. It's even quick to insert one in the middle â€” just disconnect the 
chain at the middle link, add the new paperclip, then reconnect the other half.

An item in a linked list is called a node. The first node is called the head. The last node is 
called the tail.

Confusingly, sometimes people use the word tail to refer to "the whole rest of the list after the 
head."

Unlike an array, consecutive items in a linked list are not necessarily next to each other in memory.

**Strengths**:
1. Fast operations on the ends. Adding elements at either end of a linked list is O(1). Removing 
the first element is also O(1).
2. Flexible size. There's no need to specify how many elements you're going to store ahead of 
time. You can keep adding elements as long as there's enough space on the machine.

**Weaknesses**:
1. Costly lookups. To access or edit an item in a linked list, you have to take O(i) time to walk 
from the head of the list to the ith item.

**Uses**:
1. Stacks and queues only need fast operations on the ends, so linked lists are ideal.

## Java Implementation

Most languages don't provide a linked list implementation. Assuming we've already implemented 
our own, here's how we'd construct the linked list above:

```
LinkedListNode a = new LinkedListNode(5);
LinkedListNode b = new LinkedListNode(1);
LinkedListNode c = new LinkedListNode(9);

a.next = b;
b.next = c;
```

## Doubly Linked Lists

In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.

In a doubly linked list, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes.

Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you 
just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes 
came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.

## Not cache-friendly

Most computers have caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster 
than reading from scattered addresses.

Array items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list 
nodes can be scattered all over.

So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the 
items in an array, even though they're both theoretically O(n) time.
