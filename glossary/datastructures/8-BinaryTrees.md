# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree where every node has two or fewer children. The children are usually 
called left and right.

```
public class BinaryTreeNode {

    public int value;
    public BinaryTreeNode left;
    public BinaryTreeNode right;

    public BinaryTreeNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

This lets us build a structure that looks like a tree. The root node is on top, and connects to 
2 children below it. Each of those children connect to 2 children below them, which all connect 
to their own 2 children, which all connect to their own 2 children.

That particular example is special because every level of the tree is completely full. There are 
no "gaps." We call this kind of tree "perfect."

Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they're perfect:
1. The number of total nodes on each "level" doubles as we move down the tree.
2. The number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other 
levels (plus 1). In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.

Let's call the number of nodes n, and the height of the tree h. h can also be thought of as the 
"number of levels."

If we had h, how could we calculate n?

Let's just add up the number of nodes on each level! How many nodes are on each level?

If we zero-index the levels, the number of nodes on the xth level is exactly 2^x.
1. Level 0: 2^0 nodes,
2. Level 1: 2^1 nodes,
3. Level 2: 2^2 nodes,
4. Level 3: 2^3 nodes,
5. etc

So our total number of nodes is:  
`n = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^{h-1}`

But we can simplify. Property 2 tells us that the number of nodes on the last level is (1 more 
than) half of the total number of nodes, so we can just take the number of nodes on the last 
level, multiply it by 2, and subtract 1 to get the number of nodes overall. We know the number 
of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1}, So:  
`n = 2^{h-1} * 2 - 1`  
`n = 2^{h-1} * 2^1 - 1`  
`n = 2^{h-1+1} - 1`  
`n = 2^{h} - 1`  

So that's how we can go from h to n. What about the other direction?

We need to bring the h down from the exponent. That's what logs are for!

First, some quick review. log10(100) simply means, "What power must you raise 10 to in order to 
get 100?". Which is 2, because 10^2 = 100.

We can use logs in algebra to bring variables down from exponents by exploiting the fact that we 
can simplify log10(10^2). What power must we raise 10 to in order to get 10^2? That's easy â€” it's 2.

So in this case we can take the log2 of both sides:  
`n = 2^{h} - 1`  
`n + 1 = 2^{h}`  
`log2((n+1)) = log2(2^h)`  
`log2(n+1) = h`  

So that's the relationship between height and total nodes in a perfect binary tree.
