# Graphs

## Quick Reference

A graph organizes items in an interconnected network.

Each item is a node (or vertex). Nodes are connected by edges. 
A graph is composed of nodes (or vertices) that are connected by edges.

**Strengths**:
1. Representing links. Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect 
to other things. Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, 
routers and ethernet cables, or Facebook users and their friendships.

**Weaknesses**:
1. Scaling challenges. Most graph algorithms are O(n*lg(n)) or even slower. Depending on the size 
of your graph, running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.


## Terminology

### Directed or undirected

In directed graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In 
undirected graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

### Cyclic or acyclic

A graph is cyclic if it has a cycle â€” an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or 
edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are acyclic.

### Weighted or unweighted

If a graph is weighted, each edge has a "weight." The weight could, for example, represent the 
distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.

### Legal coloring

A graph coloring is when you assign colors to each node in a graph. A legal coloring means no 
adjacent nodes have the same color.


## Representations

There are a few different ways to store graphs.

### Edge list

A list of all the edges in the graph:

`int[][] graph = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}};`

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, {1, 3} and {2, 3} are in the edge list.

Sometimes it's helpful to pair our edge list with a list of all the nodes. For example, what 
if a node doesn't have any edges connected to it? It wouldn't show up in our edge list at all!

### Adjacency list

A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node's 
neighbors:

```
int[][] graph = {
    {1},
    {0, 2, 3},
    {1, 3},
    {1, 2}
};
```

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list {1, 2}.

We could also use a hash map where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of 
neighbors.

```
Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>() {
    {
        put(0, Arrays.asList(1));
        put(1, Arrays.asList(0, 2, 3));
        put(2, Arrays.asList(1, 3));
        put(3, Arrays.asList(1, 2));
    }
};
```

This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn't 
map cleanly to array indices.

### Adjacency matrix

A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).

```
int[][] graph = {
    {0, 1, 0, 0},
    {1, 0, 1, 1},
    {0, 1, 0, 1},
    {0, 1, 1, 0},
};
```

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1. 

## Algorithms

### BFS and DFS

You should know breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) down pat so you can code 
them up quickly.

Lots of graph problems can be solved using just these traversals:

**Is there a path between two nodes in this undirected graph?** Run DFS or BFS from one node and see 
if you reach the other one.

**What's the shortest path between two nodes in this undirected, unweighted graph?** Run BFS from 
one node and backtrack once you reach the second. Note: BFS always finds the shortest path, 
assuming the graph is undirected and unweighted. DFS does not always find the shortest path.

**Can this undirected graph be colored with two colors?** Run BFS, assigning colors as nodes are 
visited. Abort if we ever try to assign a node a color different from the one it was assigned 
earlier.

**Does this undirected graph have a cycle?** Run BFS, keeping track of the number of times we're 
visiting each node. If we ever visit a node twice, then we have a cycle.

### Advanced graph algorithms

If you have lots of time before your interview, these advanced graph algorithms pop up 
occasionally:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a weighted 
graph.
2. Topological Sort: Arranges the nodes in a directed, acyclic graph in a special order based 
on incoming edges.
3. Minimum Spanning Tree: Finds the cheapest set of edges needed to reach all nodes in a 
weighted graph.
