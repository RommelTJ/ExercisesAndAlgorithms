# Graphs

## Quick Reference

A graph organizes items in an interconnected network.

Each item is a node (or vertex). Nodes are connected by edges. 
A graph is composed of nodes (or vertices) that are connected by edges.

**Strengths**:
1. Representing links. Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect 
to other things. Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, 
routers and ethernet cables, or Facebook users and their friendships.

**Weaknesses**:
1. Scaling challenges. Most graph algorithms are O(n*lg(n)) or even slower. Depending on the size 
of your graph, running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.


## Terminology

### Directed or undirected

In directed graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In 
undirected graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

### Cyclic or acyclic

A graph is cyclic if it has a cycle â€” an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or 
edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are acyclic.

### Weighted or unweighted

If a graph is weighted, each edge has a "weight." The weight could, for example, represent the 
distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.

### Legal coloring

A graph coloring is when you assign colors to each node in a graph. A legal coloring means no 
adjacent nodes have the same color.


## Representations

There are a few different ways to store graphs.

### Edge list

A list of all the edges in the graph:

`int[][] graph = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}};`

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, {1, 3} and {2, 3} are in the edge list.

Sometimes it's helpful to pair our edge list with a list of all the nodes. For example, what 
if a node doesn't have any edges connected to it? It wouldn't show up in our edge list at all!

### Adjacency list

A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node's 
neighbors:

```
int[][] graph = {
    {1},
    {0, 2, 3},
    {1, 3},
    {1, 2}
};
```

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list {1, 2}.

We could also use a hash map where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of 
neighbors.

```
Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>() {
    {
        put(0, Arrays.asList(1));
        put(1, Arrays.asList(0, 2, 3));
        put(2, Arrays.asList(1, 3));
        put(3, Arrays.asList(1, 2));
    }
};
```

This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn't 
map cleanly to array indices.

### Adjacency matrix

A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).

```
int[][] graph = {
    {0, 1, 0, 0},
    {1, 0, 1, 1},
    {0, 1, 0, 1},
    {0, 1, 1, 0},
};
```

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1.
