# Graphs

## Quick Reference

A graph organizes items in an interconnected network.

Each item is a node (or vertex). Nodes are connected by edges. 
A graph is composed of nodes (or vertices) that are connected by edges.

**Strengths**:
1. Representing links. Graphs are ideal for cases where you're working with things that connect 
to other things. Nodes and edges could, for example, respectively represent cities and highways, 
routers and ethernet cables, or Facebook users and their friendships.

**Weaknesses**:
1. Scaling challenges. Most graph algorithms are O(n*lg(n)) or even slower. Depending on the size 
of your graph, running algorithms across your nodes may not be feasible.


## Terminology

### Directed or undirected

In directed graphs, edges point from the node at one end to the node at the other end. In 
undirected graphs, the edges simply connect the nodes at each end.

### Cyclic or acyclic

A graph is cyclic if it has a cycle â€” an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or 
edges that connects back to itself. Graphs without cycles are acyclic.

### Weighted or unweighted

If a graph is weighted, each edge has a "weight." The weight could, for example, represent the 
distance between two locations, or the cost or time it takes to travel between the locations.

### Legal coloring

A graph coloring is when you assign colors to each node in a graph. A legal coloring means no 
adjacent nodes have the same color.
