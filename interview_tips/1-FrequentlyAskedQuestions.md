# Frequently Asked Questions

## What's the interview process like at a tech company?

Here are the usual steps:

1. First, you’ll do a non-technical phone screen.
2. Then, you’ll do one or a few technical phone interviews.
3. Finally, the last step is an onsite interview.

Some companies also throw in a take-home code test—sometimes before the technical phone interviews, sometimes after.

## Do I need to know this "Big O" stuff?

Big O notation is the language we use for talking about the efficiency of data structures and algorithms.

Will it come up in your interviews? Well, it depends. There are different types of interviews.

There’s the classic algorithmic coding interview, sometimes called the "Google-style whiteboard interview." It’s 
focused on data structures and algorithms (queues and stacks, binary search, etc). It's how Google, Facebook, Amazon, 
Microsoft, Oracle, LinkedIn, and so on interview.

For startups and smaller shops, it’s a mixed bag. Most will ask at least a few algorithmic questions. But they might 
also include some role-specific stuff, like Java questions or SQL questions for a backend web engineer. They’ll be 
especially interested in your ability to ship code without much direction. You might end up doing a code test or 
pair-programming exercise instead of a whiteboarding session.

To make sure you study for the right stuff, you should ask your recruiter what to expect. Send an email with a 
question like, “Is this interview going to cover data structures and algorithms? Or will it be more focused around 
coding in X language.” They’ll be happy to tell you.

## Which programming language should I use?

Companies usually let you choose, in which case you should use your most comfortable language. If you know a bunch of 
languages, prefer one that lets you express more with fewer characters and fewer lines of code, like Python or Ruby. It 
keeps your whiteboard cleaner.

Try to stick with the same language for the whole interview, but sometimes you might want to switch languages for a 
question. E.g., processing a file line by line will be far easier in Python than in C++.

Sometimes, though, your interviewer will do this thing where they have a pet question that’s, for example, C-specific. 
If you list C on your resume, they’ll ask it.

So keep that in mind! If you’re not confident with a language, make that clear on your resume. Put your less-strong 
languages under a header like ‘Working Knowledge.’

## What should I wear?

A good rule of thumb is to dress a tiny step above what people normally wear to the office. For most west coast tech 
companies, the standard digs are just jeans and a t-shirt. Ask your recruiter what the office is like if you’re worried 
about being too casual.

## Should I send a thank you note? 

Thank-you notes are nice, but they aren’t really expected. Be casual if you send one. No need for a hand-calligraphed 
note on fancy stationery. Opt for a short email to your recruiter or the hiring manager. Thank them for helping you 
through the process, and ask them to relay your thanks to your interviewers.
