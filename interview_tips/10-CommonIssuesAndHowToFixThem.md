# Common issues and how to fix them

## The biggest issues

### I keep getting lost or stuck in the middle of technical questions.

Getting stuck during a coding interview can be really demoralizing. That is, until you get good at getting 
un-stuck. That's right, you can get good at getting un-stuck! You just have to learn the steps.

But surprisingly, sometimes you're supposed to get stuck, and sometimes you're supposed to lose your train of 
thought. To understand why, read up on how the coding interview is like a maze.

Of course, with more practice you're less likely to get stuck or lose your train of thought. Check out our 
practice coding interview questions.

Finally, make sure you're doing everything you can to get yourself into the best possible headspace in the 24 
hours before your big interview.

### It takes me forever to solve a single problem.

The trick to finishing problems faster is using a specific process and sticking to it:

1. Brainstorm and design your algorithm by manipulating sample inputs by hand on the whiteboard. Don't start 
writing code until you know exactly how your algorithm will work.
2. Code it up as quickly as possible. Don't get caught up in details like, "should this be a '<' or a '<='?" — 
just make a checkmark in the margin and move on. Don't start debugging it until it's all written out.
3. Finally, walk through your code with a sample input and fix any bugs you find.

The important lesson here is to never skip ahead. Only move on to the next step after finishing the last step. 
This keeps your thinking more organized, makes it easier for your interviewer to follow what you're doing, helps 
you avoid mistakes, and ultimately makes you move faster.

This process is explained in more detail in our general coding interview tips article.

### I'm practicing, but I'm not getting better.

You're probably making a common mistake with how your practice is structured. Is this you?:

You pull up a practice problem, work on it, get as far as you can... until you get stuck. You give up and look 
at the answer.

"Whaaat?? How do you even come up with something like that?"

You understand what the answer is, but you have no idea how you could have gotten there yourself.

That's the common mistake. Simply looking at questions and answers isn't enough. You need to learn how to derive 
those answers yourself.

### I don't have a CS degree. I don't understand big O notation and algorithms.

A lot of people struggle with data structures, algorithms, and big O notation. Especially people who don't have 
a computer science degree.

It's easy to think this stuff is just objectively hard to understand, since it's associated with the "academic" 
side of software. That makes it seem more technical and difficult.

The truth is this stuff just feels technical and difficult because people are bad at teaching it.

Yes, thinking in algorithms and data structures is a specific skill that's different from general coding. It's a 
separate thing you have to learn.

But it's very learnable.

### I . . . feel like I'm just not good at this stuff :/

This feeling is very common. The interview process makes us doubt ourselves. It eats away at our confidence. 
This is called impostor syndrome, and it can be fixed.


## The rest of the job search process

### How do I get interviews?

Probably the easiest way to get interviews is to use one of these services that bring companies to you:

* Hired
* Triplebyte
* Underdog.io

These services are really selective though, so not everyone gets in.

Then there are a bunch of hip job board sites. These make it super easy to cast a wide net — just pick a bunch 
of companies that sound interesting and apply. They also let you do stuff like set up email alerts for jobs that 
might interest you.

* AngelList Jobs
* Whitetruffle
* Stack Overflow Jobs

For the companies you already have your eyes on, try to get a referral from someone inside the company. This is 
doubly important for the big names like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Big companies weigh referred 
applicants more heavily.

Search your LinkedIn and your Facebook to see if you have a friend who can refer you. Ask your family members if 
they have anyone in their network. If you went to college, ask your school's alumni services to find an alum who 
can refer you.

### But I don't know the latest hip new framework or language.

Here's a trick to getting interviews for jobs that require knowledge of a fancy new language or framework: 
ignore the job description and apply anyways.

One month after Apple announced their new programming language Swift, there were job listings that asked for 
a minimum of three years experience with Swift. Which was impossible.

A lot of description text is just boilerplate. Don’t let it keep you from applying.

The people putting job descriptions together often don’t know what all the specific technologies mean. They tend 
to pepper them with the latest buzzwords. It happens in every industry.

Many of these places will put good faith in your engineering skills. They'll trust you to learn whatever 
languages or frameworks they use.

One more tip: Don’t apologize for not knowing the hip new thing. It reveals that you think you're 
underqualified, which biases your interviewers towards thinking you're underqualified. So focus on sounding 
interested rather than apologetic. "I haven't had a chance to work with Rust yet, but I've heard some cool stuff 
about it!"

### How long should I allow for my job search?

Short answer: probably longer than you think.

Long answer: It depends.

### I got an offer but it expires soon! What do I do?

The best way to deal with exploding offers is to avoid them altogether by carefully structuring your coding 
interview timeline.

That said, once a company has given you an exploding offer, you have two options:
1. Just work within the exploding offer's timeline. In other words, do nothing.
2. Ask for an extension.

You're likely to have better luck asking for an extension if you give a specific date you want to extend to. 
From the company's perspective, they mostly just want to have some date they can trust they'll have an answer 
by, so they can plan the rest of their hiring process.

### What about behavioral questions? How do I prepare for those?

Behavioral questions or "soft questions" are an important part of the interview. Your interviewer might ask you 
something like:

* "What's the biggest project you've shipped?"
* "What's your favorite programming language? Why?"
* "How do you overcome interpersonal conflicts with coworkers?"
* Or just an open-ended, "Tell me about yourself."

Nailing these questions can be a big differentiator. If you wanna wow your interviewer, check out our article
