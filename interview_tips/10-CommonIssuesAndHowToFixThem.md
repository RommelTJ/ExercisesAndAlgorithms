# Common issues and how to fix them

## The biggest issues

### I keep getting lost or stuck in the middle of technical questions.

Getting stuck during a coding interview can be really demoralizing. That is, until you get good at getting 
un-stuck. That's right, you can get good at getting un-stuck! You just have to learn the steps.

But surprisingly, sometimes you're supposed to get stuck, and sometimes you're supposed to lose your train of 
thought. To understand why, read up on how the coding interview is like a maze.

Of course, with more practice you're less likely to get stuck or lose your train of thought. Check out our 
practice coding interview questions.

Finally, make sure you're doing everything you can to get yourself into the best possible headspace in the 24 
hours before your big interview.

### It takes me forever to solve a single problem.

The trick to finishing problems faster is using a specific process and sticking to it:

1. Brainstorm and design your algorithm by manipulating sample inputs by hand on the whiteboard. Don't start 
writing code until you know exactly how your algorithm will work.
2. Code it up as quickly as possible. Don't get caught up in details like, "should this be a '<' or a '<='?" â€” 
just make a checkmark in the margin and move on. Don't start debugging it until it's all written out.
3. Finally, walk through your code with a sample input and fix any bugs you find.

The important lesson here is to never skip ahead. Only move on to the next step after finishing the last step. 
This keeps your thinking more organized, makes it easier for your interviewer to follow what you're doing, helps 
you avoid mistakes, and ultimately makes you move faster.

This process is explained in more detail in our general coding interview tips article.

### I'm practicing, but I'm not getting better.

You're probably making a common mistake with how your practice is structured. Is this you?:

You pull up a practice problem, work on it, get as far as you can... until you get stuck. You give up and look 
at the answer.

"Whaaat?? How do you even come up with something like that?"

You understand what the answer is, but you have no idea how you could have gotten there yourself.

That's the common mistake. Simply looking at questions and answers isn't enough. You need to learn how to derive 
those answers yourself.

### I don't have a CS degree. I don't understand big O notation and algorithms.

A lot of people struggle with data structures, algorithms, and big O notation. Especially people who don't have 
a computer science degree.

It's easy to think this stuff is just objectively hard to understand, since it's associated with the "academic" 
side of software. That makes it seem more technical and difficult.

The truth is this stuff just feels technical and difficult because people are bad at teaching it.

Yes, thinking in algorithms and data structures is a specific skill that's different from general coding. It's a 
separate thing you have to learn.

But it's very learnable.

### I . . . feel like I'm just not good at this stuff :/

This feeling is very common. The interview process makes us doubt ourselves. It eats away at our confidence. 
This is called impostor syndrome, and it can be fixed.
