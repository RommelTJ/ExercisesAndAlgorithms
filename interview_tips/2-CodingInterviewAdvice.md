# Coding Interview Advice

## Chitchat like a pro

Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your background. They're looking for:
* Metacognition about coding. Do you think about how to code well?
* Ownership/leadership. Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if 
you don't have to?
* Communication. Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?

You should have at least one:

* Example of an interesting technical problem you solved
* Example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame
* Example of leadership or ownership
* Story about what you should have done differently in a past project
* Piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
* Question about the company's product/business
* Question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)

Nerd out about stuff. Show you're proud of what you've done, you're amped about what they're doing, and you have 
opinions about languages and workflows.
