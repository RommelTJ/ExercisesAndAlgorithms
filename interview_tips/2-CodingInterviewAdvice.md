# Coding Interview Advice

## Chitchat like a pro

Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your background. They're looking for:
* Metacognition about coding. Do you think about how to code well?
* Ownership/leadership. Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if 
you don't have to?
* Communication. Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?

You should have at least one:

* Example of an interesting technical problem you solved
* Example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame
* Example of leadership or ownership
* Story about what you should have done differently in a past project
* Piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
* Question about the company's product/business
* Question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)

Nerd out about stuff. Show you're proud of what you've done, you're amped about what they're doing, and you have 
opinions about languages and workflows. 

## Communicate

Once you get into the coding questions, communication is key. A candidate who needed some help along the way but 
communicated clearly can be even better than a candidate who breezed through the question.

Understand what kind of problem it is. There are two types of problems:
1. Coding. The interviewer wants to see you write clean, efficient code for a problem.
2. Chitchat. The interviewer just wants you to talk about something. These questions are often either (1) high-level 
system design ("How would you build a Twitter clone?") or (2) trivia ("What is hoisting in Javascript?"). Sometimes 
the trivia is a lead-in for a "real" question e.g., "How quickly can we sort a list of integers? Good, now suppose 
instead of integers we had ..."

If you start writing code and the interviewer just wanted a quick chitchat answer before moving on to the "real" 
question, they'll get frustrated. Just ask, "Should we write code for this?"

Make it feel like you're on a team. The interviewer wants to know what it feels like to work through a problem with 
you, so make the interview feel collaborative. Use "we" instead of "I," as in, "If we did a breadth-first search we'd 
get an answer in O(n)O(n)O(n) time." If you get to choose between coding on paper and coding on a whiteboard, always 
choose the whiteboard. That way you'll be situated next to the interviewer, facing the problem (rather than across 
from her at a table).

Think out loud. Seriously. Say, "Let's try doing it this wayâ€”not sure yet if it'll work." If you're stuck, just say 
what you're thinking. Say what might work. Say what you thought could work and why it doesn't work. This also goes 
for trivial chitchat questions. When asked to explain Javascript closures, "It's something to do with scope and putting 
stuff in a function" will probably get you 90% credit.

Say you don't know. If you're touching on a fact (e.g., language-specific trivia, a hairy bit of runtime analysis), 
don't try to appear to know something you don't. Instead, say "I'm not sure, but I'd guess this, because...". 
The because can involve ruling out other options by showing they have nonsensical implications, or pulling examples 
from other languages or other problems.

Slow the eff down. Don't confidently blurt out an answer right away. If it's right you'll still have to explain it, 
and if it's wrong you'll seem reckless. You don't win anything for speed and you're more likely to annoy your 
interviewer by cutting her off or appearing to jump to conclusions.
