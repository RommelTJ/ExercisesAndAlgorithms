# Fixing Impostor Syndrome

As you learn more, your sliver of knowledge feels like it's shrinking. That's because you brush up against more and 
more things you don’t know yet. Whole disciplines like machine learning, theory of computation, and embedded systems. 
Things you can't just pick up in an afternoon. Heavy bodies of knowledge that take months to understand.

So the universe of things you could know seems to keep expanding faster and faster—much faster than your tiny sliver 
of knowledge is growing. It feels like you'll never be able to keep up. 

We also incorrectly assume that because something is easy for us, it must be easy for everyone else. So when we look 
at our own skills, we assume they're not unique. But when we look at other people's skills, we notice the skills they 
have that we don't have.

The result? We think everyone’s knowledge is a superset of our own. This makes us feel like everyone else is ahead of 
us. Like we're always a step behind. But the truth is that there's a whole area of stuff you know that your peers 
do not know. An area you're probably blind to, because you're so focused on the stuff you don't know.

Focusing on what you don't know causes you to underestimate what you do know. And that's what causes impostor syndrome.

By looking at the vast (and expanding) universe of things you could know, you feel like you hardly know anything.

And by looking at what your peers know that you don't know, you feel like you're a step behind.

And interviews make you really focus on what you don't know. You focus on what could go wrong. The knowledge gaps 
your interviewers might find. The questions you might not know how to answer.

But remember:

Just because your peers know some things you don't know, doesn't mean you don't also know things stuff they don't know.

And more importantly, everyone's body of knowledge is just a teeny-tiny sliver of everything they could learn. We all 
have gaps in our knowledge. We all have interview questions we won't be able to answer.

You're not a step behind. You just have a lot of stuff you don't know yet. Just like everyone else.
