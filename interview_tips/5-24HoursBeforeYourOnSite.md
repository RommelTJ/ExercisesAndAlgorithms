# 24 Hours before your on-site interview

The twenty-four hours before your onsite are about finding ways to maximize your performance. Ideally, you wanna be 
having one of those days, where elegant code flows effortlessly from your fingertips, and bugs dare not speak your 
name for fear you'll squash them.

You need to get your mind and body in The Zone before you interview, and here are some suggestions.

## Don't study all night

Interviewing sleep deprived could be worse than getting drunk beforehand. Make it your mission to get a full night of 
sleep, because you want all the brain power you can get.

In fact, try to get two nights of good sleep before interviewing, since sleep debt lasts a few days.

As soon as the sun goes down, put down the practice problems and focus on relaxing. If sleeping isn't your strongest 
skill, try these sleepytime guidelines:
* Exercise lightly earlier in the day.
* Don't drink caffeine in the afternoon, and don't drink alcohol at all.
* Avoid bright screens in the evening. Dim your screen once the sun sets.
* Eat a light dinner, ideally one with noggin-friendly foods, like salmon, beans, and vegetables.
* Before bed, turn on a boring podcast, listen to some calming music, or read a book.

The most important thing is to not stay up late practicing new or difficult problems. That'll only put your brain on a 
train to Los Anxiousness. 

## Practice stuff you rock at

To cultivate your confidence, practice questions that you can already solve handily. Sure, feel free to start the day 
with a new problem, but by the afternoon you should be building momentum with the questions you know best.

Giving yourself a few wins like this helps your brain simulate a stellar session at the whiteboard. You'll go to sleep 
dreaming of data structures, and you'll wake up with a self-esteem stimulus that makes you stand out in your interview.
