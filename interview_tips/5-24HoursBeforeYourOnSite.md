# 24 Hours before your on-site interview

The twenty-four hours before your onsite are about finding ways to maximize your performance. Ideally, you wanna be 
having one of those days, where elegant code flows effortlessly from your fingertips, and bugs dare not speak your 
name for fear you'll squash them.

You need to get your mind and body in The Zone before you interview, and here are some suggestions.

## Don't study all night

Interviewing sleep deprived could be worse than getting drunk beforehand. Make it your mission to get a full night of 
sleep, because you want all the brain power you can get.

In fact, try to get two nights of good sleep before interviewing, since sleep debt lasts a few days.

As soon as the sun goes down, put down the practice problems and focus on relaxing. If sleeping isn't your strongest 
skill, try these sleepytime guidelines:
* Exercise lightly earlier in the day.
* Don't drink caffeine in the afternoon, and don't drink alcohol at all.
* Avoid bright screens in the evening. Dim your screen once the sun sets.
* Eat a light dinner, ideally one with noggin-friendly foods, like salmon, beans, and vegetables.
* Before bed, turn on a boring podcast, listen to some calming music, or read a book.

The most important thing is to not stay up late practicing new or difficult problems. That'll only put your brain on a 
train to Los Anxiousness. 

## Practice stuff you rock at

To cultivate your confidence, practice questions that you can already solve handily. Sure, feel free to start the day 
with a new problem, but by the afternoon you should be building momentum with the questions you know best.

Giving yourself a few wins like this helps your brain simulate a stellar session at the whiteboard. You'll go to sleep 
dreaming of data structures, and you'll wake up with a self-esteem stimulus that makes you stand out in your interview.

## Imagine your best day

Write out the ideal version of your day. It's a positive visualization exercise. This might sound like some hippie 
shit, but it's something athletes and entrepreneurs do all the time.

The fun part is that there isn't a correct way to do this. It's up to you! If you're not sure where to start, here's 
some inspiration:
* Greet your interviewer(s). Play through some small talk. Maybe you make a little joke they find funny.
* Crush your first question. The first question comes your way, and you write out the answer deftly. Your interviewer's 
face looks impressed.
* Overcome a tough question. You get to a trickier part of a problem. You feel some adrenaline, but you keep calm. You 
ask a few clarifying questions and carry on to a solution.
* End the day on a high note. Your last interview of the day involves talking to a director or VP, and the conversation 
is lively. You leave the building smiling and feeling great about the whole experience.

Visualizing a successful day will build your confidence. You're training your brain to expect success and feel more 
comfortable during your interview.

## Walk through your problem solving process

Reinforcing problem-solving patterns goes a longer way than practicing new problems in the hours leading up to your 
interview. Notice how our coding interview tips article gives you a handy process for solving algorithmic problems:

1. Brainstorm an algorithm. Draw out sample inputs and play around with them while talking and thinking out loud. Don't 
start writing code until you and your interviewer feel good about your algorithm.
2. Barf out your algorithm in code. Focus on getting it all down first, and jot down notes next to the things you wanna 
go back and double-check later.
3. Debug your code. Walk through your code with sample input, look for off-by-one-errors and other bugs.

This high-level, "What's my problem solving process" is great to keep thinking about the morning of your interview.
