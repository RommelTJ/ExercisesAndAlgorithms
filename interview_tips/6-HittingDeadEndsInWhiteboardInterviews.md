# Why You're Hitting Dead Ends In Whiteboard Interviews

## Listening vs. holding your train of thought

Finally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've 
came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.

Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.

Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.

When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.

"What if we thought of the problem this way?"

You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:

"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!"

This is a make-or-break moment in the coding interview. And so many people get it wrong.

Most candidates end up only half understanding what their interviewer is saying. Because they're only half listening. 
Because they're desperately clinging to their train of thought.

And it's easy to see why. For many of us, completely losing track of what we're doing is one of our biggest coding 
interview fears. So we devote half of our mental energy to clinging to our train of thought.

To understand why that's so wrong, we need to understand the difference between what we see during the coding interview 
and what our interviewer sees.

## The programming interview maze

Working on a coding interview question is like walking through a giant maze.

You don't know anything about the shape of the maze until you start wandering around it. You might know vaguely where 
the solution is, but you don't know how to get there. 

As you wander through the maze, you might find a promising path (an approach, a way to break down the problem). You 
might follow that path for a bit.

Suddenly, your interviewer suggests a different path. But from what you can see so far of the maze, your approach has 
already gotten you halfway there! Losing your place on your current path would mean a huge step backwards. 
Or so it seems.

That's why people hold onto their train of thought instead of listening to their interviewer. Because from what they 
can see, it looks like they're getting somewhere!

But here's the thing: your interviewer knows the whole maze. They've asked this question 100 times.

I'm not exaggerating: if you interview candidates for a year, you can easily end up asking the same question over 
100 times.

So if your interviewer is suggesting a certain path, you can bet it leads to an answer.

And your seemingly great path? There's probably a dead end just ahead that you haven't seen yet.

Or it could just be a much longer route to a solution than you think it is. That actually happens pretty oftenâ€”there's 
an answer there, but it's more complicated than you think.
