# How To Get The Most Out Of Your Coding Interview Practice Sessions

When you start practicing for coding interviews, there’s a lot to cover. You’ll naturally wanna brush up on technical 
questions. But how you practice those questions will make a big difference in how well you’re prepared.

Here’re a few tips to make sure you get the most out of your practice sessions.

## Track your weak spots

One of the hardest parts of practicing is knowing what to practice. Tracking what you struggle with helps answer that 
question.

So grab a fresh notebook. After each question, look back and ask yourself, "What did I get wrong about this problem at 
first?" Take the time to write down one or two things you got stuck on, and what helped you figure them out. Compare 
these notes to our tips for getting unstuck.

After each full practice session, read through your entire running list. Read it at the beginning of each practice 
session too. This’ll add a nice layer of rigor to your practice, so you’re really internalizing the lessons you're 
learning.
