# Organizing your interview timeline

## The exploding offer dilemma

Here’s the situation you wanna avoid: You've just started interviewing with a company you're really excited about. 
Another company you've been talking to for a while sends you an "exploding offer" — an offer that expires in a 
week or even 24 hours. You have to respond to the exploding offer before your final round of interviews at the 
first company.

You don't wanna have to decide between a real offer and a potential offer. Either decision has a big downside:

* If you accept the offer in front of you, you're moving forward with a nagging "What if?" — especially if you 
were excited about the other company.
* If you reject the real offer, it's possible the other company won't end up extending you an offer in the end. 
You could end up with nothing.

It's also bad for negotiation. The best way to get negotiating leverage with one company is to have an offer 
from another company. If your offers are not open at the same time, you lose that leverage.
