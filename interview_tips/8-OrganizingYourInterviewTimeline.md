# Organizing your interview timeline

## The exploding offer dilemma

Here’s the situation you wanna avoid: You've just started interviewing with a company you're really excited about. 
Another company you've been talking to for a while sends you an "exploding offer" — an offer that expires in a 
week or even 24 hours. You have to respond to the exploding offer before your final round of interviews at the 
first company.

You don't wanna have to decide between a real offer and a potential offer. Either decision has a big downside:

* If you accept the offer in front of you, you're moving forward with a nagging "What if?" — especially if you 
were excited about the other company.
* If you reject the real offer, it's possible the other company won't end up extending you an offer in the end. 
You could end up with nothing.

It's also bad for negotiation. The best way to get negotiating leverage with one company is to have an offer 
from another company. If your offers are not open at the same time, you lose that leverage.

## Work backwards from a signing date

So you want to do everything you can to ensure your offers come in at the same time. But how do you do that? 
The key is to work backwards:

**Pick a "signing date" and stick to it.** This is the date that you plan to make a final decision and sign an 
offer. This includes some allowed time for negotiating once you have all your offers in hand (more on that later).

Share your chosen signing date with every company as soon as you start talking to them. You may even want to 
ask them to confirm that they'll be able to work with your timeline. This way a company is much less likely to 
give you an offer that explodes before that date — they already know your timeline, so if they can't work with 
it they should tell you up front.

What if a company does give you an offer that explodes before your signing date, even though you told them about 
it early on? Don't panic. Politely remind them that you've been clear about your timeline from the beginning. 
Explain that you'd like to make your final decision on the date you've already shared with them.

If they still won't budge, you might be better off passing on that company — if they're comfortable squeezing 
you this early on in your relationship, that's a bad sign for how they'd treat you as an employee.

Now, some companies have policies about not having open offers for more than X days. So what if you're going 
through the interview process with one of those companies and it looks like you're moving too fast and the 
offer would come in too early and explode before the signing date you chose?

No problem. Most companies are happy to "pause" or slow down your interview process so the offer comes in 
later. This way both parties can get what they want: the company can follow their usual "offers explode after 
X days" policy, and you can have the offer still open on your pre-planned signing date.
