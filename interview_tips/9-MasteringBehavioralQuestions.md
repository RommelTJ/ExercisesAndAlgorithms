# Mastering Behavioral Questions

## “Show, don’t tell”

You’ve probably heard this advice before. Maybe it was your 10th grade English teacher. Maybe it was career 
services in college. "Remember: show, don’t tell."

And it’s good advice. When it comes to answering behavioral questions (like "Tell me about yourself") in coding 
interviews, the difference between a good answer and a great answer comes down to showing rather than telling.

The problem is, people who give you the advice of "Show, don’t tell"... are themselves failing to follow it. 
They're telling you to show, but they should be showing you how to show. That’s the hardest part!

So here are three specific tips for showing more and telling less.

## Sprinkle in specific details

Imagine two responses to the stock interview question "Tell me about yourself."

First:

    I started programming about two years ago with some personal projects. I eventually got a job at a small tech 
    company in my home town, and I’ve been working there about a year and a half. I like my job, but I’m looking 
    for a new challenge, which I think your company could provide.

Then:

    I got started programming because I wanted to build a social network for cats. That didn’t take off, but 
    the prototype helped me get a job at a small tech company in my home town.
    Last month, I read an awesome article on Hacker News about the social network your company is building. 
    The scaling challenges you face seem like they’ll help me grow faster and stronger than my current role will.

The second response says a lot more about the candidate.

Why? Because of the specific details. An interviewer won't remember the tenth person to say "I’m looking for a 
new challenge." They will remember the person who tried to build a social network for cats and read about their 
company on Hacker News.

So don’t skimp on the details. Look out for opportunities to use specifics, especially if they’re at all quirky, 
funny, surprising, or otherwise memorable.

## Tell a story from your life

Take another common question: "Why do you want to work here?"

People tend to just cross-reference their values with those of the company or team they're interviewing with:

    I’m really interested in technical blogging and open source. So I like that your company has some 
    open-source work and contributes back to the community.
   
That’s a fine response. But to really wow your interviewer, try adding a specific story around those values:
   
    A couple years ago, when I was still new to programming, I was working on this tricky bug. I found a post on 
    a company blog where an engineer explained how her team solved the issue. She included a code snippet she’d 
    open-sourced. I appreciated that she took the time to write about her team’s experience and share their 
    solution. It helped me!
    
    That’s how I first started getting into open source. I really wanna work with more engineers like that — who 
    write about their work and try to help others in the community. So I was excited to see all the stuff your 
    team shares on your blog and on the company’s Github profile.
   
The second response just sounds more genuine. It shows a personal connection to open source and technical 
blogging, instead of just telling it.

Anyone can look up a company’s core values and repeat them during an interview. It’s more meaningful to tell a 
story from your life that shows how those values benefited you or taught you something.
