# Mastering Behavioral Questions

## “Show, don’t tell”

You’ve probably heard this advice before. Maybe it was your 10th grade English teacher. Maybe it was career 
services in college. "Remember: show, don’t tell."

And it’s good advice. When it comes to answering behavioral questions (like "Tell me about yourself") in coding 
interviews, the difference between a good answer and a great answer comes down to showing rather than telling.

The problem is, people who give you the advice of "Show, don’t tell"... are themselves failing to follow it. 
They're telling you to show, but they should be showing you how to show. That’s the hardest part!

So here are three specific tips for showing more and telling less.

## Sprinkle in specific details

Imagine two responses to the stock interview question "Tell me about yourself."

First:

    I started programming about two years ago with some personal projects. I eventually got a job at a small tech 
    company in my home town, and I’ve been working there about a year and a half. I like my job, but I’m looking 
    for a new challenge, which I think your company could provide.

Then:

    I got started programming because I wanted to build a social network for cats. That didn’t take off, but 
    the prototype helped me get a job at a small tech company in my home town.
    Last month, I read an awesome article on Hacker News about the social network your company is building. 
    The scaling challenges you face seem like they’ll help me grow faster and stronger than my current role will.

The second response says a lot more about the candidate.

Why? Because of the specific details. An interviewer won't remember the tenth person to say "I’m looking for a 
new challenge." They will remember the person who tried to build a social network for cats and read about their 
company on Hacker News.

So don’t skimp on the details. Look out for opportunities to use specifics, especially if they’re at all quirky, 
funny, surprising, or otherwise memorable.
