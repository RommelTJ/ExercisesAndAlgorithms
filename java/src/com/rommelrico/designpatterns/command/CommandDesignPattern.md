# Command Design Pattern

One-size fits all pattern used when depending on situation the same command will perform a 
different action. 

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object (the game card), thereby letting you
parameterize other objects with different requests, queues or log requests.

E.g. A directional pad in a controller might do different things when you push the up button.
