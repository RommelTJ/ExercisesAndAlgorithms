### Product Of All Other Numbers

You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at 
that index.

Write a method `getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex()` that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the 
products.

For example, given:  
`[1, 7, 3, 4]`  
your method would return:   
`[84, 12, 28, 21]`  
by calculating:  
`[7 * 3 * 4,  1 * 3 * 4,  1 * 7 * 4,  1 * 7 * 3]`

Do not use division in your solution.
