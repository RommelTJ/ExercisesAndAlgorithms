/**
 * Solution
 *
 * We use a greedy approach to solve the problem in one pass. At each iteration
 * we keep track of:
 *
 *     highestProductOf3
 *     highestProductOf2
 *     highest
 *     lowestProductOf2
 *     lowest
 *
 * When we reach the end, the highestProductOf3 is our answer. We maintain the
 * others because they're necessary for keeping the highestProductOf3 up to
 * date as we walk through the array. At each iteration, the highestProductOf3
 * is the highest of:
 *
 *     the current highestProductOf3,
 *     current * highestProductOf2,
 *     current * lowestProductOf2 (if current and lowestProductOf2 are both
 *     low negative numbers, this product is a high positive number).
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time and O(1) additional space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * Greedy algorithms in action again!
 * That's not a coincidenceâ€”to illustrate how one pattern can be used to break
 * down several different questions, we're showing this one pattern in action
 * on several different questions.
 *
 * Usually it takes seeing an algorithmic idea from a few different angles for
 * it to really make intuitive sense.
 *
 * Our goal here is to teach you the right way of thinking to be able to break
 * down problems you haven't seen before. Greedy algorithm design is a big part
 * of that way of thinking.
 *
 * For this one, we built up our greedy algorithm exactly the same way we did
 * for the Apple stocks question. By asking ourselves:
 * "Suppose we could come up with the answer in one pass through the input, by
 * simply updating the 'best answer so far' as we went. What additional values
 * would we need to keep updated as we looked at each item in our set, in order
 * to be able to update the 'best answer so far' in constant time?"
 *
 * For the Apple stocks question, the only "additional value" we needed was the
 * min price so far.
 * For this one, we needed four things in order to calculate the new
 * highestProductOf3 at each step:
 *      highestProductOf2
 *      highest
 *      lowestProductOf2
 *      lowest
 *
