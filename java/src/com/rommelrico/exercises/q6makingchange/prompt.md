### Making Change

Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...

They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a method that, given:
1. an amount of money
2. an array of coin denominations  

computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for amount=4(4c) and denominations=[1,2,3](1c, 2c and 3c), your program would output 4 â€” the number of 
ways to make 4c with those denominations: 
1. 1c, 1c, 1c, 1c
2. 1c, 1c, 2c
3. 1c, 3c
4. 2c, 2c
