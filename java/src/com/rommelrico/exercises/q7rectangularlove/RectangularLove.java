/**
 * Solution
 *
 * We divide the problem into two halves:
 * 1. The intersection along the x-axis
 * 2. The intersection along the y-axis
 *
 * Both problems are basically the same as finding the intersection of two "ranges" on a 1-dimensional number line.
 *
 * So we write a helper method findRangeOverlap() that can be used to find both the x overlap and the y overlap, and
 * we use it to build the rectangular overlap.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(1) time and O(1) space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * This is an interesting one because the hard part isn't the time or space optimizationâ€”it's getting something that
 * works and is readable.
 *
 * For problems like this, I often see candidates who can describe the strategy at a high level but trip over
 * themselves when they get into the details.
 *
 * Don't let it happen to you. To keep your thoughts clear and avoid bugs, take time to:
 * 1. Think up and draw out all the possible cases. Like we did with the ways ranges can overlap.
 * 2. Use very specific and descriptive variable names.
