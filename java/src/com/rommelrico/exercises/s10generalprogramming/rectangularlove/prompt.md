### Rectangular Love

A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to 
represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.

They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. 
They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it 
will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

Write a method to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

Love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is 
parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis. They are defined as objects of Rectangle class.

Your output rectangle should be a Rectangle object as well.
