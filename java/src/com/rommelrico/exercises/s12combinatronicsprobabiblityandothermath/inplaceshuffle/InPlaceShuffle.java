/**
 * Solution
 *
 * We choose a random item to move to the first index, then we choose a random
 * other item to move to the second index, etc. We "place" an item in an index
 * by swapping it with the item currently at that index.
 *
 * Crucially, once an item is placed at an index it can't be moved. So for the
 * first index we choose from nnn items, for the second index we choose from
 * n âˆ’ 1 items, etc.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time and O(1) space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * Don't worry, most interviewers won't expect a candidate to know the
 * Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. Instead, they'll be looking for the
 * problem-solving skills to derive the algorithm, perhaps with a couple hints
 * along the way.
 *
 * They may also be looking for an understanding of why the naive solution is
 * non-uniform (some outcomes are more likely than others). If you had trouble
 * with that part, try walking through it again.
