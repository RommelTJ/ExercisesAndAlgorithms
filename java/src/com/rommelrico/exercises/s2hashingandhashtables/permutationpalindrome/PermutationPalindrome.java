/**
 * Solution
 *
 * Our approach is to check that each character appears an even number of times, allowing for only one character to
 * appear an odd number of times (a middle character). This is enough to determine if a permutation of the input string
 * is a palindrome.
 *
 * We iterate through each character in the input string, keeping track of the characters we've seen an odd number of
 * times using a hash set unpairedCharacters.
 *
 * As we iterate through the characters in the input string:
 * - If the character is not in unpairedCharacters, we add it.
 * - If the character is already in unpairedCharacters, we remove it.
 *
 * Finally, we just need to check if less than two characters donâ€™t have a pair.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time, and O(n) space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * One of the tricks was to use a hash map or hash set.
 *
 * This is the most common way to get from a brute force approach to something more efficient. Especially for easier
 * problems.
 *
 * I even know interviewers who just want to hear you say "hash map", and once they hear that they'll say, "Great,
 * let's move on."
 *
 * So always ask yourself, right from the start: "Can I save time by using a hash map?"
