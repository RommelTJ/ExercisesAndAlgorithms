/**
 * Solution
 *
 * In our solution, we make three decisions:
 * 1. We use a class. This allows us to tie our methods together, calling them on instances of our class instead of
 *    passing references.
 * 2. To handle duplicate words with different cases, we choose to make a word uppercase in our hash map only if it
 *    is always uppercase in the original string. While this is a reasonable approach, it is imperfect (consider
 *    proper nouns that are also lowercase words, like "Bill" and "bill").
 * 3. We build our own splitWords() method instead of using a built-in one. This allows us to pass each word to
 *    our addWordToHashMap() method as it was split, and to split words and eliminate punctuation in one iteration.
 *
 * To split the words in the input string and populate a hash map of the unique words to the number of times they
 * occurred, we:
 * 1. Split words by spaces, em dashes, and ellipses â€” making sure to include hyphens surrounded by characters. We
 *    also include all apostrophes (which will handle contractions nicely but will break possessives into separate
 *    words).
 * 2. Populate the words in our hash map as they are identified, checking if the word is already in our hash map in
 *    its current case or another case.
 *
 * If the input word is uppercase and there's a lowercase version in the hash map, we increment the lowercase
 * version's count. If the input word is lowercase and there's an uppercase version in the hash map, we "demote" the
 * uppercase version by adding the lowercase version and giving it the uppercase version's count.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time, and O(n) space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * To handle capitalized words, there were lots of heuristics and approaches we could have used, each with their own
 * strengths and weaknesses. Open-ended questions like this can really separate good engineers from great engineers.
 *
 * Good engineers will come up with a solution, but great engineers will come up with several solutions, weigh them
 * carefully, and choose the best solution for the given context. So as you're running practice questions, challenge
 * yourself to keep thinking even after you have a first solution. See how many solutions you can come up with. This
 * will grow your ability to quickly see multiple ways to solve a problem, so you can figure out the best solution.
