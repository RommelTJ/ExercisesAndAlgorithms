/**
 * Solution
 *
 * We do a depth-first walk through our tree, keeping track of the depth as we go. When we find a leaf, we add its
 * depth to a list of depths if we haven't seen that depth already.
 *
 * Each time we hit a leaf with a new depth, there are two ways that our tree might now be unbalanced:
 * 1. There are more than 2 different leaf depths
 * 2. There are exactly 2 leaf depths and they are more than 1 apart.
 *
 * Why are we doing a depth-first walk and not a breadth-first one? You could make a case for either. We chose
 * depth-first because it reaches leaves faster, which allows us to short-circuit earlier in some cases.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time and O(n) space.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * This is an intro to some tree basics. If this is new to you, don't worryâ€”it can take a few questions for this
 * stuff to come together. We have a few more coming up.
 *
 * Particular things to note:
 *
 * Focus on depth-first vs breadth-first traversal. You should be very comfortable with the differences between the
 * two and the strengths and weaknesses of each.
 *
 * You should also be very comfortable coding each of them up.
 *
 * One tip: Remember that breadth-first uses a queue and depth-first uses a stack (could be the call stack or an
 * actual stack object). That's not just a clue about implementation, it also helps with figuring out the differences
 * in behavior. Those differences come from whether we visit nodes in the order we see them (first in, first out) or we
 * visit the last-seen node first (last in, first out).
