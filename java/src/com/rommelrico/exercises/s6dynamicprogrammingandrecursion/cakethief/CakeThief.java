/**
 * Solution
 *
 * This is a classic computer science puzzle called "the unbounded knapsack problem."
 *
 * We use a bottom-up approach to find the max value at our duffel bag's weightCapacity by finding the max value at
 * every capacity from 0 to weightCapacity.
 *
 * We allocate an array maxValuesAtCapacities where the indices are capacities and each value is the max value at that
 * capacity.
 *
 * For each capacity, we want to know the max monetary value we can carry. To figure that out, we go through each cake,
 * checking to see if we should take that cake.
 *
 * The best monetary value we can get if we take a given cake is simply:
 * 1. that cake's value, plus
 * 2. the best monetary value we can carry in our remaining duffel bag capacity after taking the cake - which we'll
 *    already have stored in maxValuesAtCapacities.
 *
 * To handle weights and values of zero, we throw an infinity error only if a cake weighs nothing and has a positive
 * value.
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n*k) time, and O(k) space, where n is number of types of cake and k is the capacity of the duffel bag.
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * This question is our spin on the famous "unbounded knapsack problem" â€” a classic dynamic programming question.
