/**
 * Solution
 *
 * Our stick approach is as follows:
 * 1. Walk one pointer k nodes from the head. Call it rightNode.
 * 2. Put another pointer at the head. Call it leftNode.
 * 3. Walk both pointers, at the same speed, towards the tail. This keeps a distance of k between them.
 * 4. When rightNode hits the tail, leftNode is on the target (since it's k nodes from the end of the list).
 *
 * Complexity
 *
 * O(n) time and O(1) space.
 *
 * However, the stick approach might still be slightly faster, due to some caching and other optimizations that modern
 * processors and memory have.
 *
 * Let's focus on caching. Usually when we grab some data from memory (for example, info about a linked list node), we
 * also store that data in a small cache right on the processor. If we need to use that same data again soon after, we
 * can quickly grab it from the cache. But if we don't use that data for a while, we're likely to replace it with other
 * stuff we've used more recently (this is called a "least recently used" replacement policy).
 *
 * Both of our algorithms access a lot of nodes in our list twice, so they could exploit this caching. But notice that
 * in our stick algorithm there's a much shorter time between the first and second times that we access a given node
 * (this is sometimes called "temporal locality of reference"). Thus it seems more likely that our second algorithm
 * will save time by using the processor's cache! But this assumes our processor's cache uses something like a "least
 * recently used" replacement policyâ€”it might use something else. Ultimately the best way to really know which
 * algorithm is faster is to implement both and time them on a few different inputs!
 *
 * What We Learned
 *
 * We listed two good solutions. One seemed to solve the problem in one pass, while the other took two passes. But the
 * single-pass approach didn't take half as many steps, it just took the same steps in a different order.
 *
 * So don't be fooled: "one pass" isn't always fewer steps than "two passes." Always ask yourself, "Have I actually
 * changed the number of steps?"
